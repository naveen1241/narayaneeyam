Oh (wonderful indeed) is the good fortune of the people (who seek Thy Grace).

That Satva Guna, which compared to the other two Gunas (Rajas and Tamas) is absolutely pure and not tainted by them. From such pure Satva guna,Thy form was born, constituted of subtle elements and organs of senses and actions.

In that form, the fortunate ones (who have good deeds to their credit) revel. That form is delightful to the mind and ears, which the devotees can easily grasp in Thy image.

Oh Infinite Lord! Thou are the pure Brahman like the mighty ocean, changeless, ever full, and of the nature of unlimited nectarine bliss. Like many pearls in the ocean, innumerable liberated souls are absorbed in Thy Brahmic bliss and hence it is extremely resplendent. Just like the waves rise in the ocean, it is said that Thy Shuddha Satwa form has risen from the Brahman. Since the term Ansha-avataar (Sakalaa) is meant only for Thy other part incarnations. Hence why cannot Thou be called as Poorna-avataar (Nishkalaa)?
