With Thy followers Thou proceeded to attend the Raajsooya Yagna in Yudhishthiraa's city Indraprastha.

Saying so he flourished his weapons and was soon confronted by the Paandavas.

Thus he attained the supreme union with Thee which is not easily attained by the Yogis.

He was all the more confused when he mistook the floor for water and water for floor in front of the assembly hall which was built by the Asura's architect Maya, for the Pandavas.
